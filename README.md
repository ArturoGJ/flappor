## [Flappor](https://editor.p5js.org/ArturoGJ/present/nI0fRvlsX) üê•  
This project is a clone of the game 'Flappy Bird' made with P5JS and using Object oriented programming.  
It is a pretty simple project with velocity, acceleration and terminal velocity so that 'Flappor' doesn't accelerate to infinity.  
It is not done yet so it has no collisions or a game-over screen or text.
